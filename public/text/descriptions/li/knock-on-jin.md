If you've found this and are reading it, I think there's a good chance we're of a similar mind. So I see no reason to be excessively sphinx-like with you.

That is to say, a sphinx being a monster made of stone designed to guard and protect the Pharaohs' tombs, I don't intuit you wish any harm to my powerful ancestors.

It fascinates me that in modern Chinese the word jīn is slang that gets translated as "catty". Now, if you ask gold to be translated into contempary Chinese, you get 金子 or jīnzi. Then if you translate 金 or jīn to English, you get gold. If you translate 子 or zi into english you get son. Is it catty of me to think that my mind alights on some insight here? About the differences, perhaps, between modern and ancient, between East and West?

In this poesy, I was certain I wanted to play with the number 3. How depending on your handwriting, and on your angles, the same shape is at once 3, m, and w. This led me to strong desire to incorporate -- at least beginning of -- one of my favorite lines of Lao Tzu's Dao De Ching.

But then I woke up one morning possessed of an urge to make the animated knock knock joke or whatever this is... Having received my degree from Knox College, I'm more than familiar a tired joke every person over thirty seemed to make when I first graduated. "School of Hard Knocks, yeah?" Student is a very serious burden put on college graduates these days, but perhaps this, this awful haunting pun, is worse -- in part because who can allow themselves to take the burden of it seriously?

I didn't start intending to throw all of these ideas together here, but I feel pleased with the result.

I wonder if you feel similarly or if you have feedback that can knock some sense into me.

What inspired this poesy was the consideration of the hashtag, aka pound symbol. A naive view of lexicography might suggest that any symbol could have been used to indicate distinct topics on social media. But when you look at the actual shape of the thing with eyes unprejudiced with previous meanings, what you see? I see a piece of a net.


Perhaps this idea isn’t so original. 

My intention was to give viewers a feeling of ever pressing richness, childishness, and anxiety of our — now no longer so young — idea-laden information age as embodied in the four to twelve lines comprising the hashtag, depending on how you dice it.

My fear is that you'll feel like you're being hexed, attacked by a swarm of square bees, or hs, or 4s, or undergoing some ancient form of dripping water torture that never ends.

Or being chased by a four-year-old who just learned how to say "you're it".

Or learning for the first time why asia is so superstitiously blocked up about the number four.

Worse than that though, would be a tech addict out there assuming that watching this animated poesy might in anyway replace the experience of goofing off, or going off grid.
